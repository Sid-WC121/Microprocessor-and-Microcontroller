<h2> :sparkle: <em>Assembly Language</em> </h2>
<p>Assembly language is a low-level programming language that is used to write instructions that can be executed by a computer's processor. It is a symbolic representation of machine code, which is the binary code that a computer's CPU can directly execute. Assembly language allows programmers to write human-readable code that can be converted into machine code using an <i><b>assembler</b></i>, a special program that translates assembly language instructions into binary code.</p>
<p>In assembly language, each instruction is represented by a mnemonic, which is a short code that represents a specific operation or instruction.</p>

***
>_Assembly language is often used for low-level programming tasks such as writing device drivers, operating systems, and embedded systems. While it can be more difficult to learn and use than high-level programming languages, assembly language can be more efficient and allow for greater control over a computer's hardware._

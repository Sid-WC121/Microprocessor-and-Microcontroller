<h3> Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)</h3>
  
- It is a circuit that performs arithmetic and logical operations on data, including addition, subtraction, comparison, shifting, and logical operations. It works with the Accumulator and two temporary registers (W and Z) to hold data temporarily during operations.

<h3>Registers</h3>

- Registers are small memory elements within the CPU that provide temporary storage for data, instructions, and addresses during execution. They are directly connected to the processor for quick access without delays. The number of registers varies between processors. In the Intel 8085, there are 8 registers, including the Accumulator (A register) and 6 general-purpose registers (B, C, D, E, H, and L), arranged as a register array. Each register can be used as an 8-bit register to store 8-bit data or paired with another register to store 16-bit data. The HL register pair, known as the Memory Address Register (MAR) or Memory Pointer, is used to store memory addresses.
